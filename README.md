### To-do
> #### CRUD operation for Parts
> - Only `CREATE` and `READ` operations implemented so far

> #### Logging 
> - Invalid `PartIDs` currently handled by removing from orders list and printing to console
> - Need to log to a logging file

> #### JSONata
> - Not clear whether JSONata needs to be integrated into the Java program, or whether the queries are executed separately
> - How to output into separate files from separate JSONata query?
